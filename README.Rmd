## Overview

The simple linear regression model $Y_i={\beta_0}+{\beta_1}X_i+{\epsilon_i}$ is a model that summarizes the relationship between an independent variable X (predictor) and a dependent variable Y (response). ${\beta_0}$ and ${\beta_1}$ are usually unknown and need to be estimated using observed data (X~1~,Y~1~), (X~2~,Y~2~),..., (X~n~,Y~n~), and ${\epsilon_i}$ is a random error term. 

Deriving the estimators ${\hat{\beta_0}}$ and ${\hat{\beta_1}}$ by the method of least squares would help to obtain the fitted model ${\hat{Y}}={\hat{\beta_0}}+{\hat{\beta_1}}X$ (equivalently, $Y_i={\hat{\beta_0}}+{\hat{\beta_1}}X_i+{\hat{\epsilon_i}}$). The model is considered to best approximate the (X,Y) relationship, and thus ${\hat{Y}}={\hat{\beta_0}}+{\hat{\beta_1}}X$ is also called the euqation of best-fitting line.

The goal of slrmodel is to calculate ${\hat{\beta_0}}$ and ${\hat{\beta_1}}$ using the method of least squares for a set of (X,Y), test the significance of (X,Y) association, and compute the proportion of variation in Y that is explained by the model. 

* `slr_beta()` creates a matrix of coefficients of the fitted model. 
* `slr_rsquared()` calculates the coefficient of determination R^2^.

## Installation

You can install the development version of slrmodel from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("lyvqian/slrmodel")
```

## Usage

This is a basic example which shows you how to use the slrmodel package. The built-in dataset `iris` is employed.

```{r}
library(slrmodel)

slr_beta(iris$Petal.Width,iris$Petal.Length) #slr_beta(x, y)

slr_rsquared(iris$Petal.Width,iris$Petal.Length) #slr_rsquared(x, y)
```
Both `slr_beta()` and `slr_rsquared()` have two arguments, `x` and `y`. `x` is a vector containing all observed predictors, while `y` is a vector containing all corresponding responses. In this case, `x` is a vector containing all values of petal widths of iris flowers, and `y` is a vector containing all values of petal lengths of iris flowers.

The result of `slr_beta()` is a matrix with 2 rows and 4 columns. The upper row provides ${\hat{\beta_0}}$, the standard error of ${\beta_0}$, the t statistic for testing whether ${\hat{\beta_0}}$ significantly differs from 0, and the p value for determining the significance. The lower row provides the same coefficients for ${\hat{\beta_1}}$.

The result of `slr_rsquared()` is R^2^, the coefficient of determination. It tells the proportion of variation in `Y` that is explained by the ${\hat{Y}}={\hat{\beta_0}}+{\hat{\beta_1}}X$ model.

With ${\hat{\beta_0}}$ and ${\hat{\beta_1}}$, we can plot the best fitting line, which is ${\hat{Y}}=1.08+2.23X$ in this example:

```{r, include = FALSE}
plot(iris$Petal.Width,iris$Petal.Length,xlab="The petal widths of iris flowers",ylab="The petal lengths of iris flowers")
intercept = slr_beta(iris$Petal.Width,iris$Petal.Length)[1, 1]
slope = slr_beta(iris$Petal.Width,iris$Petal.Length)[2, 1]
abline(intercept, slope)
```
