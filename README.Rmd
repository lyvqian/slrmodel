## Overview

The simple linear regression model $Y_i={\beta_0}+{\beta_1}X_i+{\epsilon_i}$ is a model that summarizes the relationship between an independent (predictor) variable X and a dependent (response) variable Y. ${\beta_0}$ and ${\beta_1}$ are usually unknown and need to be estimated using observations (X~1~,Y~1~), (X~2~,Y~2~),..., (X~n~,Y~n~), and ${\epsilon_i}$ is a random error term. 

The method of least squares is a common way used to derive estimators ${\hat{\beta_0}}$ and ${\hat{\beta_1}}$. The corresponding fitted model ${\hat{Y}}={\hat{\beta_0}}+{\hat{\beta_1}}X$ (equivalently, $Y_i={\hat{\beta_0}}+{\hat{\beta_1}}X_i+{\hat{\epsilon_i}}$) is considered to best approximate the (X,Y) relationship. 

The goal of slrmodel is to figure out the fitted model $Y_i={\hat{\beta_0}}+{\hat{\beta_1}}X_i+{\hat{\epsilon_i}}$ using the method of least squares, test the significance of (X,Y) association, and compute the proportion of variation in Y that can be explained by X. 

* `slr_beta()` creates a matrix of key coefficients of the fitted model. 
* `slr_rsquared()` calculates the coefficient of determination R^2^.

## Installation

You can install the development version of slrmodel from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("lyvqian/slrmodel")
devtools::install_github("lyvqian/slrmodel", build_vignettes = T) # install with vignettes
```

## Usage

This is a basic example which shows you how to use the slrmodel package. The built-in dataset `iris` is employed.

```{r}
library(slrmodel)

slr_beta(x = iris$Petal.Width, y = iris$Petal.Length)

slr_rsquared(x = iris$Petal.Width, y = iris$Petal.Length)
```
Both `slr_beta()` and `slr_rsquared()` have two arguments, `x` and `y`. `x` is a vector containing all observed predictors, while `y` is a vector containing all corresponding responses. In this case, `x` is a vector containing all values of petal widths of iris flowers, and `y` is a vector containing all values of corresponding petal lengths.

The result of `slr_beta()` is a matrix with 2 rows and 4 columns. The upper row provides ${\hat{\beta_0}}$, the standard error of ${\hat{\beta_0}}$, the t statistic for testing whether ${\hat{\beta_0}}$ significantly differs from 0, and the p value for determining the significance. The lower row provides the corresponding values for ${\hat{\beta_1}}$.

The result of `slr_rsquared()` is R^2^, the coefficient of determination. It tells the proportion of variation in Y that is explained by X.

With ${\hat{\beta_0}}$ and ${\hat{\beta_1}}$, we can plot the fitted line, which is ${\hat{Y}}=1.08+2.23X$ in this example:

```{r, include = FALSE}
plot(iris$Petal.Width,
     iris$Petal.Length,
     xlab = "The petal widths of iris flowers",
     ylab = "The petal lengths of iris flowers")
intercept = slr_beta(iris$Petal.Width, iris$Petal.Length)[1, 1]
slope = slr_beta(iris$Petal.Width, iris$Petal.Length)[2, 1]
abline(intercept, slope)
```
