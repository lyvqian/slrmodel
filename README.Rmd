## Overview

The simple linear regression model $y={\beta_0}+{\beta_1}x+{\epsilon}$ is a model that summarizes the relationship between an independent variable `x` (predictor) a dependent variable `y` (response). ${\beta_0}$ and ${\beta_1}$ are usually unknown and need to be estimated using observed data (x~1~,y~1~), (x~2~,y~2~),..., (x~n~,y~n~), and ${\epsilon}$ is a random error term. Deriving the estimators ${\hat{\beta_0}}$ and ${\hat{\beta_1}}$ by the method of least squares would help to obtain the best-fitting line ${\hat{y}}={\hat{\beta_0}}+{\hat{\beta_1}}x$, that is, the straight line demonstrating the best approximation of the given set of data. The goal of slrmodel is to calculate the ${\hat{\beta_0}}$ and ${\hat{\beta_1}}$ using the method of least squares, test the significance of (x,y) association, and evaluate the overall fitness of the ${\hat{y}}={\hat{\beta_0}}+{\hat{\beta_1}}x$ model. 

* `slr_beta()` creates a matrix of coefficients (${\beta}$,$SE(\hat\beta)$, t statistic, and p-value) of the simple linear regression model. 
* `slr_rsquared()` calculates the coefficient of determination R^2^.

## Installation

You can install the development version of slrmodel from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("lyvqian/slrmodel")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(slrmodel)

```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r iris}
summary(iris)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
