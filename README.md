## Overview

The simple linear regression model
$Y_i={\beta_0}+{\beta_1}X_i+{\epsilon_i}$ is a model that summarizes the
relationship between an independent (predictor) variable X and a
dependent (response) variable Y. ${\beta_0}$ and ${\beta_1}$ are usually
unknown and need to be estimated using observations
(X<sub>1</sub>,Y<sub>1</sub>), (X<sub>2</sub>,Y<sub>2</sub>),â€¦,
(X<sub>n</sub>,Y<sub>n</sub>), and ${\epsilon_i}$ is a random error
term.

The method of least squares is a common way used to derive estimators
${\hat{\beta_0}}$ and ${\hat{\beta_1}}$. The corresponding fitted model
${\hat{Y}}={\hat{\beta_0}}+{\hat{\beta_1}}X$ (equivalently,
$Y_i={\hat{\beta_0}}+{\hat{\beta_1}}X_i+{\hat{\epsilon_i}}$) is
considered to best approximate the (X,Y) relationship.

The goal of slrmodel is to figure out the fitted model
$Y_i={\hat{\beta_0}}+{\hat{\beta_1}}X_i+{\hat{\epsilon_i}}$ using the
method of least squares, test the significance of (X,Y) association, and
compute the proportion of variation in Y that can be explained by X.

- `slr_beta()` creates a matrix of key coefficients of the fitted model.
- `slr_rsquared()` calculates the coefficient of determination
  R<sup>2</sup>.

## Installation

You can install the development version of slrmodel from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("lyvqian/slrmodel") 
```

You can also install the package with vignettes:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("lyvqian/slrmodel", build_vignettes = T)
```

## Usage

This is a basic example which shows you how to use the slrmodel package.
The built-in dataset `iris` is employed.

``` r
library(slrmodel)

slr_beta(x = iris$Petal.Width, y = iris$Petal.Length)
#>       Estimate Std. Error t statistic      p-value
#> beta0 1.083558 0.07296696    14.84998 4.043318e-31
#> beta1 2.229940 0.05139623    43.38724 4.675004e-86

slr_rsquared(x = iris$Petal.Width, y = iris$Petal.Length)
#> [1] 0.9271098
```

Both `slr_beta()` and `slr_rsquared()` have two arguments, `x` and `y`.
`x` is a vector containing all observed predictors, while `y` is a
vector containing all corresponding responses. In this example, `x` is a
vector containing all values of petal widths of iris flowers, and `y` is
a vector containing all values of petal lengths.

The result of `slr_beta()` is a matrix with 2 rows and 4 columns. The
upper row provides ${\hat{\beta_0}}$, the standard error of
${\hat{\beta_0}}$, the t statistic for testing whether ${\hat{\beta_0}}$
significantly differs from 0, and the p value for determining the
significance. The lower row provides the corresponding values for
${\hat{\beta_1}}$.

The result of `slr_rsquared()` is R<sup>2</sup>, the coefficient of
determination. It tells the proportion of variation in Y that is
explained by X.

With ${\hat{\beta_0}}$ and ${\hat{\beta_1}}$, we can plot the fitted
line, which is ${\hat{Y}}=1.08+2.23X$ in this example: ![Image
